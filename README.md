## üß† **Model Architecture**  

The AI model utilizes the **Tiny ViT** architecture, designed for efficiency and accuracy. Key components include:

- **`tiny_vit_21m_224`**: A lightweight Vision Transformer pre-trained with 21 million parameters, optimized for 224x224 image inputs.
- **`TinyVitLightning`**: A custom PyTorch Lightning module that integrates the Tiny ViT model with additional components like a classification head and a loss function.

---

## üìä **Datasets**  
The model is trained using the following datasets from Kaggle:

- [Street Location Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/killusions/street-location-images)
- [Geolocation GeoGuessr Images 50k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ubitquitin/geolocation-geoguessr-images-50k)
- [Streetview Photospheres](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikitricky/streetview-photospheres/data)
